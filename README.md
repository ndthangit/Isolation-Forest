### Dataset
[NI-UQ-NIDS dataset](https://rdm.uq.edu.au/files/e2412450-ef9c-11ed-827d-e762de186848). 
## Overview
The NetFlow University of Queensland Network Intrusion Detection Dataset (NF-UQ-NIDS) is a combination of four distinct datasets using a newly proposed set of standardized features. These datasets are UNSW-NB15 (2015), CSE-CIC-IDS2018 (2018), BoT-IoT (2018), and ToN-IoT (2019) - the former two are also present in this collection (see related entries), while the latter two deal with IoT systems and are thus not included. The main goal of the authors is the introduction of the aforementioned standard feature set (based on NetFlow v9) to be used with anomaly-based NIDS, facilitating evaluation and comparison between different models and classifiers - efforts which are normally hardly useful due to feature spaces that are almost exclusive from one another. Additionally, a standardized feature set allows for agglomeration of different datasets, which is precisely what NF-UQ-NIDS is. Two different feature sets were developed, a shorter version containing twelve features (v1) as well as a longer version made up of 43 features (v2).

## Environment
Details regarding the environment of UNSW-NB15 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 can be found in their respective entries. The homepages of BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT are also linked below.

## Activity
Specific details of benign and malicious behavior within a given dataset can again be found using the respective entries/links. Here, the authors simply condensed all categories of behavior from each dataset into a single list (ordered by frequency of occurrence):
